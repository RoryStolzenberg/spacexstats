SpaceX's second launch of Falcon 1 occurred nearly 1 year after the first spectacular failure, in which the vehicle ended up scattered across a nearby reef. It again launched from Omelek Island in Kwajalein Atoll, but only after numerous delays involving computer issues and scheduling conflicts with a Minuteman III missile test flight. Falcon 1’s second flight was much more successful than the first, yet it too ultimately failed to deliver its payload simulator into Low Earth Orbit.

The first stage performed well, but shortly after stage separation the interstage bumped the second stage engine nozzle. This was due to higher than expected rotation rates on the rocket, which in turn were caused by an incorrect propellant utilization file being loaded into the engine computer. That error resulted in slightly lower thrust causing the rocket to be travelling lower and slower than predicted - the additional aerodynamic forces at stage separation imparted more force than they normally would have had the rocket been at the correct altitude, causing the higher-than-expected rotation. Nonetheless, the vehicle performance was within acceptable limits until T+4 minutes and 25 seconds.

At this point, a circular corkscrew oscillation began than increased in amplitude until video was lost and the vehicle started to roll at T+5:01, eventually exceeding the capacity of the roll control thrusters to null out the rotation. Finally, the fuel in the tank centrifuged and at T+7:30 the second engine shut down due to flame out. All evidence points to the excess roll being caused by Liquid Oxygen sloshing in the tank - baffles were added in future flights to address this problem.

The vehicle eventually coasted to an altitude of 289km with a final velocity of 5.1km/s, short of the 7.5km/s needed to achieve orbit. Regardless, Falcon 1’s second flight was declared a partial success, as it flight-tested 95% of the rockets componentry.
